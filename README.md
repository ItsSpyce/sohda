# Sohda

This repository is the monorepo for the Sohda ecosystem. All projects are within `packages` with the following layout:

- `api`: the core API to describe Sohda, mixes, and configurations
- `app`: the desktop app written in Electron. This may run as a CLI if requested
- `next`: the web app built on NextJS
